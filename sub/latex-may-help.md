* Build and test (on macOS). See the exact example in _Building TeX Live (2019)_, [Sec. 4.5](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html#Build-one-package).
    * Update binary file. Substitute file `xdvipdfmx` resides in `` `kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFDIST`/../bin/<os-dependent-dir> ``.

## MiKTeX - A LaTeX Distribution

## Projects implementing TeX by Different Programming Languages

### JavaTeX Project, by Timothy Murphy

An introduction to this Project is published on [1999 TUGboat](https://www.tug.org/TUG99-web/pdf/murphy.pdf). This project is also uploaded to CTAN as a package [named `javatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/javatex?lang=en). The performance is so poor that the author "considers it unusable in practice", by its readme on CTAN.

## Journal

[The PracTeX Journal](http://tug.org/pracjourn/2012-1/toc.html), the online journal of the TeX Users Group, has published [20 issues](http://tug.org/pracjourn/archive.html) from 2005 to 2012.
