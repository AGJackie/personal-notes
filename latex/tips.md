# Tips About Using LaTeX

## Which version of format am I using?

* The format version appears in the first line of every `.log` file <BR>(note the date **`2018.5.3`** following `preloaded format=xelatex `):

   ```
   This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99999 (TeX Live 2018) 
   (preloaded format=xelatex 2018.5.3)  2 OCT 2018 11:39
   ```
* Put `\fmtversion` in your `.tex` file, and it will out put the format version info into the `.pdf` file, in a format of `yyyy/mm/dd` (e.g. `2018/04/01`).
* Since the format version is restored in command `\fmtversion`, you can get the value of it from the terminal, with the help of [`texdef`](https://ctan.org/pkg/texdef?lang=en):

    ```bash
    $ latexdef fmtversion

    \fmtversion:
    macro:->2018-04-01
    ```
