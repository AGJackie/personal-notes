# Computer Sciences
Some notes on computer science, mostly online sources.

## Programming Languages

### Scheme

* [Code Style](http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-style) from Community Scheme Wiki
* [Comment Style](http://community.schemewiki.org/?comment-style) from Community Scheme Wiki
* Choice of using dialect of Scheme used by SICP:
  * [MIT Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) maintained by GNU, or
  * [SICP collections](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) as a package of Racket

## Books
